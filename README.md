# Programming-Experience
A collection of all the assignments i have done while at the university of lincoln and in my own time.

Parallel programming module - 
1. using OpenCL with C++ to create a simple program for analysing a large amount of data. This used parallel hardware and the implementation of a parallel software component written in OpenCL to return data such as memory transfer, kernel execution and total program execution times for performance assessment.

Advanced programming module - 
1. using C++ to develop a simple tool for defining and handling basic geometric shapes in 2D. This used inheritance, classes, methods virtual classes and more to apply the concepts of advanced software development and programming methods.

Algorithms and complexity module - 
1. using C++ to design and implement a search and sort application that can be activated using a console terminal. This looked at understanding the time and space efficiency of algorithms and how to calculate, evaluate and improve them.

Web authoring module - 
1. Produce a mood board and basic wireframe of a chosen site using adobe XD.  
2. Using HTML, CSS and java script, implement the designs and make a functioning website that can be hosted on a webserver.

Programming and Data structures - 
1. using C# create a program which manually read in data from a .csv file and then calculates some summary statistics such as averages of the data when different filters are applied which only target data from certain groups.
2.Converting a colour value from HEXIDECIMAL to an RGB value with C#.
3.Creating a game using multiple classes, methods and standard C++ practices such as error handling, exception handling to create a game that runs cleanly and can run from start to end without problems..

Scalable Database Systems - 
1. Designing a database for a repair services company. Appraise and analyse a case study then explain how the system works while indentifying a reasonable list of services and prices. Create a DFD for the system and identify entities, relationships, initial conceptual design, preliminary design of entity types and preliminary design of relationship types. Drawn an ER model

Network Fundamentals - 
1.Creating and modifying networks using cisco packet tracer

Internet of Things - 
1.Propose the desing and inmpementation approaches for an IOT prototype that is well considered regrading functionality and interaction it provides users. 
2.Create and deploy an IOT hub ro recieve and ingest simulated network sensor data which is then saved to a suitable cloud storage service by crating an IoT hub trigger.
