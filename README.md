# Programming-Experience
A collection of all the assignments i have done while at the university of lincoln and in my own time.

Parallel programming module - using OpenCL with C++ to create a simple program for analysing a large amount of data. This used parallel hardware and the implementation of a parallel software component written in OpenCL to return data such as memory transfer, kernel execution and total program execution times for performance assessment.

Advanced programming module - using C++ to develop a simple tool for defining and handling basic geometric shapes in 2D. This used inheritance, classes, methods virtual classes and more to apply the concepts of advanced software development and programming methods.

Algorithms and complexity module - using C++ to design and implement a search and sort application that can be activated using a console terminal. This looked at understanding the time and space efficiency of algorithms and how to calculate, evaluate and improve them.

Advanced programming module - Creating a game using multiple classes, methods and standard C++ practices such as error handling, exception handling to create a smooth experience free of errors of any kind.

Web authoring module -Produce a mood board and basic wireframe of a chosen site using adobe XD.  Using HTML, CSS and java script, implement the designs and make a functioning website that can be hosted on a webserver.

Programming and Data structures - using C# create a program which manually read in data from a .csv file and then calculates some summary statistics such as aveages of the data when different filters are applied which only target data from certain groups.
