# Programming-Experience
A collection of all the assignments i have done while at the university of lincoln and in my own time.

Parallel programming module - 
1. using OpenCL with C++ to create a simple program for analysing a large amount of data. This used parallel hardware and the implementation of a parallel software component written in OpenCL to return data such as memory transfer, kernel execution and total program execution times for performance assessment.

Advanced programming module - 
1. using C++ to develop a simple tool for defining and handling basic geometric shapes in 2D. This used inheritance, classes, methods virtual classes and more to apply the concepts of advanced software development and programming methods.

Algorithms and complexity module - 
1. using C++ to design and implement a search and sort application that can be activated using a console terminal. This looked at understanding the time and space efficiency of algorithms and how to calculate, evaluate and improve them.

Web authoring module - 
1. Produce a mood board and basic wireframe of a chosen site using adobe XD.  
2. Using HTML, CSS and java script, implement the designs and make a functioning website that can be hosted on a webserver.

Programming and Data structures - 
1. using C# create a program which manually read in data from a .csv file and then calculates some summary statistics such as averages of the data when different filters are applied which only target data from certain groups.
2. Converting a colour value from HEXIDECIMAL to an RGB value with C#.
3. Creating a game using multiple classes, methods and standard C++ practices such as error handling, exception handling to create a game that runs cleanly and can run from start to end without problems..

Scalable Database Systems - 
1. Designing a database for a repair services company. Appraise and analyse a case study then explain how the system works while indentifying a reasonable list of services and prices. Create a DFD for the system and identify entities, relationships, initial conceptual design, preliminary design of entity types and preliminary design of relationship types. Drawn an ER model

Network Fundamentals - 
1. Creating and modifying networks using cisco packet tracer

Internet of Things - 
1. Propose the desing and inmpementation approaches for an IOT prototype that is well considered regrading functionality and interaction it provides users. 
2. Create and deploy an IOT hub to recieve and ingest simulated network sensor data which is then saved to a suitable cloud storage service by crating an IoT hub trigger. This was done using the Google development manager

Artifitial intelligence -
1. Independent and individual implementation of solutions to AI planning problems using  PDDL to move into a room and complete a series of instructions. The goal was to write a PDDL domain that can solve a planning problem for floor-cleaning robots.A set of robots has the task to clean floor tiles. The robots can move
around the floor tiles in four directions (up, down, left and right). Robots have a brush
mounted at the front and at the back, so they can clean in front and behind them (up
and down, respectively), but they cannot turn around. The robots, however, cannot
drive on wet surfaces, so they must never drive onto tiles they have already cleaned
(and are therefore wet).

Project -  
1. Optimising the efficincy of a swarm robot navigation algorithm using ARGoS simulator. This involved increasing the swarm completion rate (number of robots that complete the task) of a robot swarm while increasing the speed of task completion.
2. Using matlab to compare the performances of an enhanced swarm algorithm versus the original algorithm

Machine Learning -
1. Solve a polynomial regresison example using only pandas library for data management, scikit learn and other pre-built libraries are prohibited.
2. Analyse a dataset comprising a number of cancer screening tests. load in the dataset and report summary statistics and then proceed to data pre-processing. To visualise the data two plots are to be used, the first a boxplot, the second a density plot. Next is discussion on selectiong an algorithm. The best performing machine learning model has to be chosen amongst  group of trained models. Lastly, an ANN has to be designed for classifying patients as healthy or cancerous based on their clinical features.
The best performing model has to be chosen and explained.

Cloud computing - 
1. Design and develop a cloud 'infrastructure-as-code' solution for a business scenario using YAML and Jinja
2. Select and describe cloud computing models, usign justification on selecting suitable clud-based services that fall under the selected cloud model for a large business wanting to migrate and upgrade its data storage and other associated services to support ongoing business expansion.

Big Data - 
1.  Analyse a city-cycle fuel comsumption in miles per gallon in terms of a number of attributes, using linear regression and statistical analysis techniques in MATLAB. No built in libraries can be used. All code and functions must be hand written from scratch.
2.  Analyse a dataset of pressurised water reactors with various easurements in different parts of reactors. Create a summary statistics of the data and show in a table, the correlation matrix of the features where each element in the matrix shows the correlation coefficient of two features. Do a classification and analysis of the dataset by splitting it into a train and test set then train a decisiont ree, support vector machine model and an artificial neural network using the training set and applu the trained classifiers to the test set. 

Autonomous Mobile robotics - 
1. Develop a reactive robot behaviour programmed in Python using ROS(Robot Operating System) that enables a robot to find a goal in a maze utilising the robot's sensors(LIDAR, Odometry and camera).
